### XGBoost Forex Trading Simulation

This repository contains a forex (foreign exchange) trading simulation powered by machine learning. 
It leverages the XGBoost algorithm, a robust and efficient gradient boosting classifier, to predict the movements in currency pair prices. 
The model trains on historical forex data to learn patterns and make informed trading decisions in a simulated environment.

Features include:

* Data preprocessing and feature engineering scripts.
* Implementation of the XGBoost classifier.
* Performance metrics to evaluate trading strategies.
* Visualization tools for analyzing model predictions and trading outcomes.

This project aims to provide insights into the application of machine learning in financial markets, specifically forex trading, and to explore the potential of XGBoost in market prediction tasks.
